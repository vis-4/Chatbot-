# Chatbot-
## Project Overview

This mini-project involves building a basic rule-based chatbot using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The chatbot accepts user input, processes it through predefined conditions, and dynamically updates the interface with some of the given random responses. The project helped strengthen my understanding of JavaScript logic, event handling, and interactive UI behavior.
